## Understanding JVM
- it turns java code into instructions that any computer will understand, so anyone who `git clone` your program, they can run it.
- it provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed. 
- JVM creates a platform to run java bytecode and converting into different language which computer hardware can understand.
- when JRE (Java runtime env) is installed, it automatically deploy the code to create JVM for particular platform.


## Edge cases to think about
- If the app crashed half way, maybe the process can restart where it last stopped rather than restarting?
